# Olympic Athlete Analysis
This project is an analysis on Olympic data from 1950 to 2016. 

## Motivation
The motivation for this project is to help coaches in choosing athletes that are likely to win medals. We also want to give insight to aspiring olympic athletes to determine if they want to pursue the olympics. Lastly we want to find patterns in olympic data to gauge the chances of winning medals. We are also curious if there are any factors that contribute to winning medals 

## Methodology
Our methodology consisted of cleaning our dataset where we removed rows with NaNs and extracted the medal winning athletes. We also visualized our data and analyzed our plots to find patterns and eventually give recommendations based on the trends
